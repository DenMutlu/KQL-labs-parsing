 # Welcome to the Parsing & Advanced KQL training session

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) Training**! 

In today’s session, we’ll explore the **Parsing fundamentals**, the **Microsoft Sentinel’s ASIM framework** and how it can be used to normalize and standardize data across various sources. Parsing data with ASIM allows for more efficient threat detection, cross-source analytics, and streamlined data correlation, empowering security analysts to tackle complex challenges with consistency and ease. Finally we will practice on Azure Data Explorer with Advanced KQL Queries!

During this training, we’ll cover:
- An overview of ASIM, its components, and its place within Microsoft Sentinel.
- Hands-on exercises to practice using ASIM parsers and schemas for querying data.
- How to create custom rules, analytics, and workbooks that leverage ASIM's power.

By the end of this session, you’ll have a solid foundation in using ASIM to enhance your data’s consistency and make your security operations more effective.

## Good Luck!

Learning new tools and concepts can sometimes be challenging, but it’s also rewarding. Stay curious, ask questions, and, most importantly, enjoy the learning process. This is an opportunity to deepen your skills and contribute to a stronger security posture within your organization.
